# ROS_Global_Path_Plan

# Path Planning Repository
This repository contains packages and code that are helpful for path planning using the A* and Dijkstra algorithms. Additionally, custom global server and client scripts are provided to control the movement of the TurtleBot according to the path generated by the implemented path planning algorithms

# Contents

The repository consists of the following packages:

global_path_plan: This package provides the simulation environment for path planning on Gazebo. It includes the mbot_simulation.launch file, which is used to run the simulation on Gazebo. The simulation environment allows you to test and visualize the path planning algorithms using a virtual robot.

kobuki_description: This package contains the description files for the Kobuki robot. It includes the necessary URDF and mesh files to visualize and simulate the Kobuki robot in ROS.

turtlebot_description: This package contains the description files for the TurtleBot robot. It includes the necessary URDF and mesh files to visualize and simulate the TurtleBot robot in ROS.
